                                <p> Ritu ji aap toh super hit ho gaye!!!
                                    I can’t tell you today how many people told us about the ambience. In short I can say the ambience of the place took over everything else including the silver couple!!!
                                    People just loved the stage and the tree.
                                    I didn’t once feel the need to visit the site before the party as I knew once I gave the job to you, my job is already done and I can just relax.
                                    You came personally to overlook the work done for such a small budget work was also really nice.
                                    Ab aap meri bacho ki shaadi ke liye taiyaar ho jaiye. For that event which would definitely be on a larger scale than this, I would be able to give you better budget to work on!!!
                                    Best part I haven’t yet told you, the owner of the hotel Anjana ji remarked she hasn’t seen a décor like this in her hotel and asked me to forward your number. Hum ne bhi thora collar oopar karke credit leliya and told her I have worked with you many times. You just know exactly what we want and execute it to perfection!!! Thank you so much
